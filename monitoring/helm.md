## Helm

Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes.

Helm is a tool that streamlines installing and managing Kubernetes applications. Think of it like apt/yum/homebrew for Kubernetes.

* Helm has two parts: a client (helm) and a server (tiller)
* Tiller runs inside of your Kubernetes cluster, and manages releases (installations) of your charts.
* Helm runs on your laptop, CI/CD, or wherever you want it to run.
* Charts are Helm packages that contain at least two things:
    * A description of the package (Chart.yaml)
    * One or more templates, which contain Kubernetes manifest files
* Charts can be stored on disk, or fetched from remote chart repositories (like Debian or RedHat packages)

### Installing helm

```
$ brew install kubernetes-helm

$ helm init # will also installer Tiller in the cluster so make sure you are using the right cluster

$ helm search # get all available packages
```
